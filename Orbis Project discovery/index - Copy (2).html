          <!--description below-->
          <p>(CONTINUE PROJECT FROM A TEAM'S WORK LAST YEAR)  Ankeny has a growing population of students whose home language or first language is not English.  When new families move into the district, we want them to feel welcome and informed about their new school and district.  At a conference, we learned that other schools are welcoming these families through videos that introduce them to the school and some key people within the school.  We would love to re-create this type of video at the schools with EL populations within Ankeny and offer the video in multiple languages.  We would hope to involve our own EL students in the decision-making and creation of these videos, but we know we cannot do it alone!  We would love help brainstorming key information to include in the videos, creating scripts, filming, editing, etc. for this project.</p>
